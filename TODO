- c / matlab / python bindings

- switch to cmake, package up into a shared library

- add a CLI?

- figure out some clever way to avoid repeated work in div funcs?
    - ie to do both BC and Hellinger without recomputing the common alpha part
    - possibly not worth the effort...

- don't compute both directions unless a div func needs both
    - add a typedef to div funcs noting this?

- more tests
    - one where bag sizes are different
        - but the matlab estimator is wrong here:
          L2 crashes, alpha-based have wrong constant
