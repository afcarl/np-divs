- add multithreading

- add a reasonable CLI

- figure out some clever way to avoid repeated work in div funcs?
    - ie to do both BC and Hellinger without recomputing the common alpha part
    - possibly not worth the effort...

- don't compute both directions unless a div func needs both

- add more tests?

- investigate the (smallish) differences from matlab results

- investigate valgrind's errors about uninitialized memory
