- investigate the differences from matlab results
    - fix_terms being a little different?
    - are the rhos/nus the same?
    - something else?

- c / matlab / python bindings

- switch to cmake, package up into a shared library

- add a reasonable CLI

- figure out some clever way to avoid repeated work in div funcs?
    - ie to do both BC and Hellinger without recomputing the common alpha part
    - possibly not worth the effort...

- don't compute both directions unless a div func needs both

- more tests
    - especially one that's not 2D

- investigate valgrind's errors about uninitialized memory
