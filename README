This is a C++ implementation of Support Distribution Machines, including both
the nonparametric divergence estimators described in

    Barnabas Poczos, Liang Xiong, and Jeff Schneider.
    Nonparametric divergence estimation with applications to machine learning
    on distributions.
    Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, 2011.

and methods for hooking those estimators up to support vector machines for
classification, regression, and anomaly detection.
