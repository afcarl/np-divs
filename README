This is a C++ implementation of the nonparametric divergence estimators

Requirements:
  * FLANN (http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/FLANN)
  * Boost (http://boost.org) - tested back to 1.33.1 but 1.35 or newer preferred
  * CMake (http://cmake.org)

Optional dependencies:
  * HDF5 (http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)

Testing requirements:
  * HDF5
  * Google Test (code.google.com/p/googletest/)


To build:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

To run tests before installing (recommended, but has more dependencies), use
    cmake -DBUILD_TESTING=ON .. # pass GTEST_ROOT=/path/to/gtest if necessary
    make
    make test ARGS=-V

Note that the computationally expensive Gaussians50DTest case is disabled by
default, as it is unlikely to reveal any errors with your installation not shown
by the Gaussians2DTest. If you would like to run it anyway, do
    make test ARGS=-v GTEST_ALSO_RUN_DISABLED_TESTS=1

To install to somewhere other than /usr/local, add e.g.
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME to the cmake command
